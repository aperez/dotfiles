This is a collection of dotfiles and scripts for installing and configuring the
tools I use day to day. Scripts and configurations in this repository assume the
user is running an Arch-based linux distribution.

* Installation
  To install the software packages:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    make install-packages
  #+END_SRC
  You might be prompted for your password.

  To symlink configuration files into their appropriate places:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    make stow
  #+END_SRC

  =make all= runs the two aforementioned targets.
