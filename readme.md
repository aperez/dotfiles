# My Dotfiles

This is a collection of dotfiles and scripts for installing and configuring
the tools I use day to day.

## Installation

To install the packages:
```
$ make install-packages
```
You might be prompted for your password.

To symlink configuration files into their appropriate places:
```
$ make stow
```

`make all` runs the two aforementioned targets.
